# animbackground
A simple program to animate the background on Windows 10/11.

will **NOT** work on other operating systems than Windows. It *may* work on older windows versions, but I dont have a virtual machine to test it on so whatever.

To use:
1) Download `wallpaper.py` and put it in a folder.
2) Add in backgrounds following the *exact* format "backgroundFRAME.png" (where FRAME is when it appears in order). For example, a directory could look like:
```
/animbackground
|--- background1.png
|--- background2.png
|--- background3.png
|--- background4.png
|--- background5.png
|--- wallpaper.py
```
3) Run `wallpaper.py`. Fill out the requested fields.
4) ???
5) Profit!
